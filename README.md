CHRONIC DISEASES PREDICTION SYSTEM USING MACHINE LEARNING<br>
Nowadays most people are suffering with the many chronic diseases and getting effected by those without having the knowledge. In this prediction system we established a single streamlit interface for three different machine learning disease prediction models. Our interface includes three diseases which are heart disease, diabetes, and paralysis agitans disease. Our heart disease model is developed using the logistic regression which explores whether the person have healthy heart or not by taking the needed inputs which are explored in further sections. Our diabetes model predicts whether the person has diabetes or not and it is developed through SVM classifier. The paralysis agitans model is developed through convolution neural network (CNN) which enhances whether the person suffers fro the disease or not. All these models are embedded in the streamlit interface which is the python framework for making website interface. User can interact with these models through this interface by giving needed inputs and predicting their disease and enacting to them early before they get worst.
